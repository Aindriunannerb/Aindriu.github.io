    <h1>Audio Visual 1</h1>
        <p>This is a small portfolio of the projects I worked on during the Audio Visual 1 module in
        semester three.</p>
        
        
        
    <h2>Greenway Advertisement for Smarter Travel Competition </h2>   
        <p>This was a short clip made radio ad made for the smarter travel competition.
            I was given a range of topics to choose from and decided on the Greenway. I wrote the script
            and enlisted the help of my class mate and lecturer Gianlucca and Colm, for the voice acting.
            The audio was recorded in the Waterford Institute of Technologys recording studio. The audio samples heard 
            in this ad were found on freesamples.org
        </p>

<h2>Hiphop Mashup for Waterford Vikings</h2>
<p>This one minute mashup was created for timeouts during Waterford Vikings basketball games. With
    time being the limiting factor in this assignment I had to squeeze the essence of each song into about
    15 seconds.
